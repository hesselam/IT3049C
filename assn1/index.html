    My name is Adam Hesselbrock and I am a fourth-year studying electronic media in the College-Conservatory of Music. I've expanded my studies to other colleges at the University of Cincinnati with an additional major in communication and certificates in both public relations & web development. For the past three seasons, I've worked as a sound technician in Kings Island’s Live Entertainment Department. Working at Kings Island has been a very educational experience that expanded my knowledge of audio engineering. I also serve as a supervisor at EnterTrainment Junction, the world’s largest indoor train display. Working at an entertainment attraction, I've grown my interpersonal skills as well as my managerial skills. While at UC, I've become a founding member of Queen City Sound District where I am a performer as well as the president. I also serve as a resident advisor and I am on the executive board for Bearcast Media where I am the general manager. After graduation, I would like to work in audio engineering, public relations, or visual design.

    What is my experience with development?
    
    <br>
    <br>

    In electronic media, I've taken two new media classes where I learned about HTML and CSS. Since then, I've helped to launch a website for a new student organization on campus and I also served as the webmaster for UCommunicate. During the spring semester, I declared my web development certificate so I am taking this class as a part of the program.
